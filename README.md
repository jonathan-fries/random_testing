# random_testing
Test out various sources of random numbers and see how they behave.

This is a basic test harness for testing different sources of randomness. At the moment it has only minimal functionality.  

MINIMAL

It can test Math.Random() in the browser and it can use Random.org.  In order to use Random.org you must supply your own license.  

To supply your own license, make a copy of the file called random_license_template.js.  Rename it to random_license.js, and paste your license from Random.org into the file.

It does not currently have a UI to view the results, which means  you can only see them by pausing the code in the browser.

Not terribly functional, but I am working on it.
